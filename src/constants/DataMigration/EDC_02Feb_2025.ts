                    1) Changes to PayNow payment process wef 1 Apr 2025 â€“ To inform CPF EZPay employers using Corporate PayNow that they will need to make payment within 7 working days from date of submission before submission expires (instead of about 2 months currently). [~40k employers] [Note: The new 7-working-day payment deadline is expected to have minimal impact on employers. Our data shows that only 0.16% of employers currently make PayNow payments beyond 7 working days from the submission date; this represents an average of 84 employers per month.]
                    2) Changes to bank transfer (MEPS) payment process wef 1 Apr 2025 â€“ To inform CPF EZPay/PAT employers using bank transfer that they will need to enter CSN without dashes in bank payment reference and need to make payment within 7 working days from date of submission before submission expires. [ ~ 1k employers] [Note: The new 7-working-day payment deadline is expected to have minimal impact on employers. Our data shows that only 7.03% of employers are currently making MEPS payments beyond 7 working days from submission date; this represents an average of 105 employers per month.]
                    3) Discontinuation of Direct Debit 'Last Day Deductionâ€™ wef 1 Apr 2025 for PAT employers â€“ To inform Provident and Tax (PAT) employers on Direct Debit â€˜Last Day Deductionâ€™ that all deductions will take place 2 working days upon CPF submission (currently deduction will take place on 14th of the month if they submit between 1st to 12th of the month, or 2 working days later if they submit after 12th of the month). [~2k employers] 

                    For email notifications (1) and (2), we will implement a two-phase approach:
                    â€¢	Phase 1 (First week of Feb 2025): We will send the email notification to a pilot cohort comprising employers who have been paying beyond 7 working days from date of submission. After the email notification is sent, CSD will then call selected employers to gather feedback on the clarity of the communicated changes and find out if employers have any concerns about meeting the new payment deadline of 7 working days. 
                    â€¢	Phase 2 (Second week of Feb 2025): Based on the feedback received, CSD will refine the email content if necessary. The updated email notification will then be sent to all remaining employers.
                    Subsequently, CSD will send email reminders in second week of Mar 2025 for all 3 email notifications.
                    CSD anticipate that there may be some enquiries from employers about the changes and will share more information, including FAQs, holding lines and notification templates with CUG nearer to the date for sending the notifications.`
